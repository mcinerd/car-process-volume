# Car Process LED Volume

This project uses the JavaScript library Three.js to build an interactive 3D representation of an LED volume used for "car process" filmmaking. 

The LED volume is composed of three ground-supported LED walls and a flown ceiling wall. 
Each of these LED walls displays footage previously shot with a 360 degree camera on a rigged car. This kind of footage is commonly known as "driving plates".
The footage on each wall matches it corresponding angle from the driving plate so that the left wall displays the left view, the front wall displays the front view, etc.
Synced together, the LED volume gives the illusion of being inside a moving car.
This technique, known as car process, is useful for filming driving scenes in film & television within the controlled confines of a sound stage, without the need for costly vehicle rigs and location permits. 

This web application allows the user to orbit around the volume, change driving plates, vehicles and camera angles.
