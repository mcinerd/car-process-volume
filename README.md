# car-process-volume

This project uses the JavaScript library Three.Js to build a 3D interactive representation of an LED volume used for car process filmmaking. 

The volume is composed of three ground-supported LED walls and a flown ceiling. 
Each of these walls displays a previously filmed "driving plate" mapped to its corresponding angle. 
The front wall displays the front plate, the left wall displays the left plate, etc.

This web application allows the user to orbit around the volume, as well as change driving plates, cars and camera angles.
